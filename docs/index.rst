Dockle
======

Dockle builds documentation with multiple frameworks and gives the generated sites one coherent visual language.
Projects configure Dockle rather than maintaining configuration for every underlying generator.

.. important::

   Dockle is pre-alpha. Its adapters are ready for experimentation, but the public configuration and distribution
   contracts may still change before version 1.0.

Compare every adapter
---------------------

Each example presents the same authoring components and a native API reference. That makes framework differences easy
to spot without unrelated content getting in the way.

.. raw:: html

   <div data-dockle-target-cards></div>

Quick start
-----------

Install Dockle with the adapters your project uses, describe each documentation target in ``dockle.toml``, then let
Dockle generate and invoke the native configuration:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install "dockle[all]"
   dockle check
   dockle build

The output is one publishable site. Dockle owns the common navigation, search, typography, color scheme, components,
and project identity while each upstream framework continues to parse its own source language.
